# Loop Collab

A collaborative platform for musicians to share, store, and collaborate on audio loops and samples.

## 📋 Overview

Loop Collab allows users to upload audio files, organize them into projects, and collaborate with other musicians. The platform features a robust tagging system that enables users to categorize and sort sounds by different attributes. Users can distinguish between master sounds and project-specific sounds, making organization and discovery more intuitive. The integrated waveform visualization provides a visual interface for audio playback.

## ✨ Features

User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT
Sound Management: Upload, categorize, and manage audio files
Project Organization: Create projects and associate sounds with them
Tagging System: Add tags to sounds for better organization and filtering
Waveform Visualization: Visual representation of audio files for intuitive interaction
Collaboration Tools: Add sounds to existing projects and fork projects
Project Forking: Create new projects based on existing ones
Multitrack Player: Play multiple sounds simultaneously with volume control
Project tree: Visualize the project forks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, Material-UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary for audio file storage
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loop-collab-project2.git cd loop-collab-project2```

2. Install dependencies for both client and server

```cd client && npm install cd ../server && npm install```

3. Create environment variables
   - Create `.env` file in the server directory with:
     ```
     PORT=5005
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
     CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_cloudinary_key
     CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_cloudinary_secret
     ```
   - Create `.env` file in the client directory with:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5005/api
     ```

4. Start the development servers

In the server directory
npm run dev

In the client directory
npm run dev
